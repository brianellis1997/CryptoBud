## ðŸš€ Immediate Next Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Train Your Models (REQUIRED)

You need to train the models before the dashboard will work:

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate cryptobud

# Option A: Use the quick start script (recommended)
python quick_start.py

# Option B: Train manually
python data/historical_data.py  # Fetch data first
python models/train_model.py     # Train models
```

**Expected time**: 15-30 minutes for 2-3 coins

### Step 2: Test the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` and verify:
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Price data displays correctly
- [ ] Charts render properly
- [ ] Predictions show up (toggle on/off)
- [ ] Delta analysis appears

### Step 3: Review and Customize

Check these files and customize to your needs:
- `requirements.txt` - Update version numbers if needed
- `dashboard/app.py` - Adjust UI colors, layout, refresh intervals
- `models/train_model.py` - Tune hyperparameters (epochs, batch size)

## ðŸ”§ Configuration & Tuning

### Model Hyperparameters

Edit `models/lstm_model.py` or `train_model.py`:

```python
# Current defaults
sequence_length = 90      # Number of past data points to use
prediction_steps = 5      # How many steps ahead to predict
lstm_units = [100, 75, 50]  # LSTM layer sizes
dropout_rate = 0.2        # Dropout for regularization
learning_rate = 0.001     # Adam optimizer learning rate
batch_size = 32          # Training batch size
epochs = 50              # Number of training epochs

# Try experimenting with:
sequence_length = 120     # More history
prediction_steps = 10     # Longer predictions
lstm_units = [128, 96, 64, 32]  # Deeper network
```

### Data Fetching

Edit `data/historical_data.py`:

```python
# Fetch more historical data
df = fetcher.fetch_all_coins(days=365)  # 1 year instead of 180 days

# Add more technical indicators
# Check utils/preprocessing.py for adding custom indicators
```

### Dashboard Settings

Edit `dashboard/app.py`:

```python
# Auto-refresh interval (line ~130)
if time_since_refresh >= 60:  # Change 60 to 30 for faster refresh

# Supported coins (add more)
available_coins = {
    'bitcoin': 'BTC',
    'ethereum': 'ETH',
    'binancecoin': 'BNB',  # Add new coins
    'dogecoin': 'DOGE',
    # etc...
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimization

### If Dashboard is Slow:

1. **Increase cache TTL**
   ```python
   @st.cache_data(ttl=300)  # Change 300 to 600 (10 minutes)
   ```

2. **Reduce data points**
   ```python
   # Fetch less historical data for charts
   historical_df = fetch_historical_data(selected_coin, days=3)
   ```

3. **Load models once**
   ```python
   # Models are already cached with @st.cache_resource
   # Don't change this unless you know what you're doing
   ```

### If Training is Slow:

1. **Reduce epochs**
   ```python
   history = trainer.train(..., epochs=30)  # Instead of 50
   ```

2. **Use GPU (if available)**
   - TensorFlow will automatically use GPU if CUDA is set up
   - Check: `python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"`

3. **Smaller batch size**
   ```python
   batch_size = 16  # Instead of 32
   ```

## ðŸš¢ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Test all features locally
- [ ] Train models for all supported coins
- [ ] Verify models are in `saved_models/` directory
- [ ] Update README with latest features
- [ ] Set up Git LFS for large model files (if >100MB)
- [ ] Add secrets.toml for API keys (don't commit!)
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Set up error logging
- [ ] Monitor API rate limits

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Models not loading
```bash
# Verify models exist
ls -lh saved_models/

# Retrain if needed
python models/train_model.py
```

### Data fetching errors
```bash
# Test API connection
python -c "from data.fetch_crypto_data import CryptoDataFetcher; print(CryptoDataFetcher().get_current_prices())"
```

### Dashboard won't start
```bash
# Check Streamlit installation
streamlit --version

# Reinstall if needed
python -m pip install --upgrade streamlit
```
