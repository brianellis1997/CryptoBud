# Quick Answers to Your Questions

## 1. Real-Time Updates - Every Second vs Every 60 Seconds

### Current Situation:
- **CoinGecko API**: Limited to 10-30 calls per MINUTE (free tier)
  - This is why I set 60-second refresh

### NEW SOLUTION: Binance WebSocket
I just created `data/binance_websocket.py` which gives you:
- ‚úÖ **Updates EVERY SECOND** (or even faster!)
- ‚úÖ **TRUE real-time streaming** via WebSocket
- ‚úÖ **No API rate limits** for reading data
- ‚úÖ **Free to use** - Binance public WebSocket

### How to Use It:

**Option 1: Demo Mode (NO TRAINING REQUIRED!)**
```bash
conda activate cryptobud
streamlit run dashboard/demo_app.py
```
This shows **real-time prices updated every second** without any model training!

**Option 2: Full Version with Predictions** (requires training)
I can update the main dashboard to use WebSocket instead of CoinGecko.

## 2. Your System Specs - Can You Train Models?

### Your Hardware:
- ‚úÖ **Apple M1 Pro** - EXCELLENT for ML!
- ‚úÖ **10 CPU cores** (8 performance + 2 efficiency)
- ‚úÖ **16 GB RAM** - Perfect for this project
- ‚úÖ **Metal GPU acceleration** - Built into M1

### Training Performance Estimate:
- **Per coin**: ~5-10 minutes
- **5 coins**: ~25-50 minutes total
- **Your M1 Pro will handle this EASILY!**

**Verdict: You absolutely CAN train on your machine! No need for Colab.**

## 3. Must You Train the Models?

### Short Answer:
**No for demo mode, Yes for predictions**

### Two Options:

#### Option A: Demo Mode (Available NOW - No Training!)
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/demo_app.py
```
**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time prices (every second!)
- ‚úÖ Live charts
- ‚úÖ 24h statistics
- ‚úÖ Multi-coin view
- ‚ùå NO predictions (models not needed)

#### Option B: Full Mode with AI Predictions (Requires Training)
```bash
# Train first
python quick_start.py

# Then run
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```
**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Everything from Demo Mode
- ‚úÖ LSTM predictions (5 steps ahead)
- ‚úÖ Prediction overlay on charts
- ‚úÖ Delta analysis
- ‚úÖ Trend indicators

## 4. What Features Are Used for Training?

### Currently Using:
- **Price only** (single feature)

### Available Features (calculated but not used yet):
The code already calculates these technical indicators:
1. **Returns** - Percentage change
2. **SMA 7-day** - Simple Moving Average
3. **SMA 30-day** - Longer moving average
4. **EMA 12-day** - Exponential Moving Average
5. **EMA 26-day** - Longer EMA
6. **RSI** - Relative Strength Index (14-day)
7. **Volatility** - 7-day standard deviation
8. **Volume** - 24h trading volume
9. **Market Cap**

### To Use More Features:
Edit [models/train_model.py](models/train_model.py) line 34:
```python
# Current (single feature):
feature_columns=['price']

# Multi-feature (better predictions):
feature_columns=['price', 'volume', 'rsi', 'sma_7', 'ema_12']
```

**Note:** Using more features:
- ‚úÖ Can improve prediction accuracy
- ‚úÖ Captures more market dynamics
- ‚ùå Takes slightly longer to train
- ‚ùå Requires more memory (still fine for your M1 Pro)

## Your Next Steps - Choose Your Path:

### Path 1: "I Want to See It NOW!" (Recommended First)
```bash
conda activate cryptobud
streamlit run dashboard/demo_app.py
```
- No training needed
- See real-time prices immediately
- Updates every second via WebSocket

### Path 2: "I Want AI Predictions!" (After seeing demo)
```bash
conda activate cryptobud
python quick_start.py
```
This will:
1. Fetch historical data (~5 min)
2. Train models (~25-50 min for 5 coins)
3. Launch full dashboard with predictions

### Path 3: "Quick Training - Just Bitcoin" (Fast option)
Edit [models/train_model.py](models/train_model.py) and change:
```python
train_single = True  # Already set
coin = 'bitcoin'     # Train just BTC (~5-10 min)
```

Then:
```bash
python models/train_model.py
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

## Technical Details

### WebSocket vs REST API:

**CoinGecko REST API:**
- Polling-based (you ask for data)
- Rate limited (10-30 calls/minute)
- Good for: Historical data, less frequent updates

**Binance WebSocket:**
- Push-based (server sends you data)
- No practical rate limits for consumption
- Updates: Every second or on every trade
- Good for: Real-time monitoring, live dashboards

### Why 60 Seconds Before?
CoinGecko free tier only allows 10-30 API calls per minute. If we refreshed every second, we'd hit the limit in 10-30 seconds and get blocked!

### Why Binance WebSocket is Better for Real-Time:
- Unlimited price updates
- Lower latency (~100ms vs 1-2 seconds)
- More reliable for streaming
- No risk of rate limiting

## FAQ

**Q: Will WebSocket use more resources?**
A: Minimal! WebSocket keeps one connection open vs making repeated HTTP requests. Actually more efficient!

**Q: Do I need a Binance account?**
A: No! The WebSocket is public and free. No account or API key needed.

**Q: Can I use both CoinGecko and Binance?**
A: Yes! Use Binance for real-time prices, CoinGecko for historical data and training.

**Q: Should I train on Google Colab instead?**
A: No need! Your M1 Pro is perfect for this. Colab would add complexity for no benefit.

**Q: Can I train on fewer epochs to save time?**
A: Yes! Edit `epochs=50` to `epochs=20` in train_model.py. Will train faster but slightly less accurate.

## Recommended Workflow:

1. **Start with Demo** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard/demo_app.py
   ```
   See real-time prices, understand the interface

2. **Train One Model** (10 minutes)
   ```bash
   python models/train_model.py  # Just Bitcoin
   ```
   See how training works

3. **Test Full Dashboard** (2 minutes)
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard/app.py
   ```
   See predictions for Bitcoin only

4. **Train All Models** (Later, 30-50 minutes)
   ```bash
   python quick_start.py
   ```
   Train all 5 coins when you have time
